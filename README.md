Image encryption using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a vital aspect of securing sensitive visual information. With the increasing reliance on digital imagery in various domains, protecting image data from unauthorized access and tampering has become crucial. This project focuses on implementing AES, a widely adopted symmetric encryption algorithm, to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of images.

The AES algorithm operates on blocks of data, making it suitable for image encryption. In this project, each image is treated as a collection of pixel values, and AES encryption is applied to these pixel blocks. The key strength of AES, coupled with its efficiency, makes it an excellent choice for securing images against potential threats.

The encryption process involves generating a random Initialization Vector (IV) for each image, enhancing security by introducing variability. The IV, along with the encryption key, is utilized to transform pixel values in a manner that makes the encrypted image resistant to unauthorized decryption.

To decrypt the image, the same key and IV must be used. This ensures that only authorized parties with the correct key can access the original image. The project provides a comprehensive solution for image encryption, emphasizing the importance of key management and secure implementation of AES.

This image encryption approach has applications in various fields, including secure image transmission, storage, and protection of sensitive visual data. The implementation showcases the versatility of AES in safeguarding digital images, contributing to the broader realm of information security.
